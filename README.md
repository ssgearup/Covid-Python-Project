# Covid-Python-Project
In this project, I have acquired the dataset from Coursera. I loaded it in jupyter notebook and performed various pandas manipualtion to cover the insights from the data. The Covid data set is joined with the happiness index dataset to pull the various insights like which country people are living happily in the tough times. A general comparison was done with the help of plotting.
